# Voronoi
How to mimic an 'autistic' NN algorithm (our goal is to make NN algorithms with various distance function equivalent (in some sense)):
- How to make two 1-NN algorithms with distance functions Lp and Lq, and unknown 0 < p,q < âˆž classify in the same way?
- How to learn Lq classifier to work like Lp one?
